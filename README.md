Expense Reimbursement System (ERS)
This system helps to manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses such as lodging, traveling, and food while on the company's time. With this system, both employees and finance managers can log in and view different reimbursements. For the employees, when they log in, they can only view their own reimbursements and they can also submit a new reimbursement. When submitting a reimbursement, they must include the type of reimbursement, as mentioned earlier, the date, the amount, and they must upload a picture of the itemized receipt. For the finance managers, when they log in, they have access to all of the employees' reimbursements and they have the ability to approve or deny a reimbursement depending on whether or not they feel that it fits the company's requirements.
